# Neurohackademy 2020 MRI Overview Project

Welcome to the mri overview in flowcharts project. Our goal: Bring newcomers together (maybe with some experienced coders!) to develop some flowcharts and/or overview materials that will increase our understanding of the start-to-finish MRI/fMRI/DTI analysis process by collaborating on interactive flowcharts, which we hope can be shared more broadly to help others similarly understand how these processes flow at a macro level. 


## Project Files
* [The site](https://mri-overview.github.io/mri-overview/) is now availible on github pages!

* [The Streamlined Content for Flowchart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OS48G1jEBcArDIN76jh5PFHGoJSeqfGSTE23ve7lfjk/edit?usp=sharing) is what will actually be populated into the website.
